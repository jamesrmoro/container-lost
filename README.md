**Year 2200** – On an international transport mission, the industrial maintenance and ring-fighting robot **XR-77** was en route to its new destination. But something went wrong. After an unexpected storm, the freighter sank. Now, lost at sea, XR-77 awakens… Inside a floating container. Deranged consoles, insane sound systems, and hostile drones also fell into the waters.
